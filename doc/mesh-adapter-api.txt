BlueZ D-Bus Mesh Adapter API description
********************************

Overview
========

This document describes API for a mesh-io (e.g. `tcpserver`) configuration.


AccessControlList Hierarchy
===========================
Service		org.bluez.mesh
Interface	org.bluez.mesh.AccessControlList1
Object path	/org/bluez/mesh/{tcpserver_<port>}
                                where <port> is a TCP port on which
                                TCP server is listening.

Methods:
    uint64 token GrantAccess(array{byte}[16] uuid,
                             array{byte}[16] dev_key,
                             array{byte}[16] net_key)

        Grants access to an internal TCP server for a TLS Client defined by
        its UUID & device and network key. Computes an identity and
        a pre-shared key based on these arguments. Computed values with an
        randomly generated token are permanently stored in the configuration
        file as an ACL entry.

        The token parameter is a 64-bit number that has been assigned to
        the access entry when it was created. The daemon uses the token
        to verify whether the application is authorized revoke access.

        array{byte}[16] uuid

            UUID of the TLS Client.

        array{byte}[16] dev_key

            Device Key of the TLS Client.

        array{byte}[16] net_key

            Primary Network Key of the TLS Client (device must be provisioned).

        PossibleErrors:
            org.bluez.mesh.Error.AlreadyExists
            org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments
            org.bluez.mesh.Error.Failed

    void RevokeAccess(uint64 token)

        Removes the ACL entry identified by the 64-bit token parameter.
        The token parameter has been obtained as a result of successful
        GrantAccess() method call.

        PossibleErrors:
            org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments
            org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotFound
            org.bluez.mesh.Error.Failed


Connection State Hierarchy
==========================
Service		org.bluez.mesh
Interface	org.bluez.mesh.ConnectionState1
Object path	/org/bluez/mesh/<adapter>/<identity>
                where <adapter> is an adapter identifier e.g. {tcpserver_65254}
                <identity> is client TLS identity hint, calculated after
                calling GrantAccess() method.

Properties:
    bool Connected [read-only]

        This property indicates if the mesh adapter is connected.

    string LastError [read-only]

        This property indicates last error.

        The defined values are: "none", "handshake-error"

    uint64 TransmittedMsgCount [read-only]

        This property indicates count of transmitted messages.

    uint64 ReceivedMsgCount [read-only]

        This property indicates count of received messages.

    uint64 LastTransmittedMsgTimestamp [read-only]

        This property indicates timestamp of last transmitted message.

    uint64 LastReceivedMsgTimestamp [read-only]

        This property indicates timestamp of last received message.

    uint64 DroppedTransmittedMsgCount [read-only]

        This property indicates count of dropped transmitted messages.

    uint64 DroppedReceivedMsgCount [read-only]

        This property indicates count of dropped received messages.

    string AdditionalInformation [read-only] [optional]

        This property contains additional information about mesh adapter.
