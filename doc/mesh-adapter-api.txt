Service		org.bluez.mesh
Interface	org.bluez.mesh.AdapterManager1
Object path	/org/bluez/mesh/adapter

Methods:
	uint64 token Add(string io_type, dict config)

	    This is method that an application has to call to
	    add a new mesh adapter with an IO type.

	    The config parameter is a dictionary with configuration
	    options specific for the chosen IO type. In case of "tcpserver",
	    mesh adapter with given UUID and NetworkKey can added only once.
	    When adapter with UUID and NetworkKey is already exists then
	    AlreadyExists error will be raised. When one of required
	    configuration options is missing then InvalidArguments
	    error will be raised.

        string io_type

            This parameter choose which IO type will be used
            to communicate with an adapter.

            The defined values are: "tcpserver", "silvair"

        dict config

            Options available for the "tcpserver" IO:

                int Port

                    Port for listening for incoming connections.
                    This field is mandatory.

                array{byte}[16] UUID

                    uGateway UUID in 16-byte array format.
                    This field is mandatory.

                array{byte}[16] DeviceKey

                    uGateway Device Key in 16-byte array format.
                    This field is mandatory.

                array{byte}[16] NetworkKey

                    uGateway Network Key in 16-byte array format.
                    Device must be already provisioned.
                    This field is mandatory.

            Options available for the "silvair" IO:

                string SerialPort

                    Serial port to which Silvair Radio is attached.

                int Baudrate

                    Serial port baudrate value.

                string Mode

                    Serial port mode: 8N1.

		PossibleErrors:
		    org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments,
		    org.bluez.mesh.Error.AlreadyExists,

	void Remove(uint64 token)

        This removes the configuration information about the mesh adapter
        identified by the 64-bit token parameter. The token parameter
        has been obtained as a result of successful Add() method call.
        When configuration for adapter with passed toked does not exist
        NotFound error will be raised.

	    PossibleErrors:
	        org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotFound,
	        org.bluez.mesh.Error.Failed

	void Configure(uint64 token, dict config)

	    This configures mesh adapter identified by the 64-bit token
	    parameter. The token parameter has been obtained as a result of
	    successful Add() method call. The config parameter should
	    contains options related to selected IO type, in case of
	    passed parameter that is not supported by the IO type, then
	    InvalidArguments error will be raised. If configuration with
	    passed token doesn't exist then NotFound error will be raised.

	    PossibleErrors:
	        org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotFound,
	        org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments

Interface	org.bluez.mesh.Adapter1
Object path	/org/bluez/mesh/adapter/{io_type}/<id>
                where <id> can be Adapter UUID or
                Serial port name (depends on IO type).

Methods:
	void Remove(uint64 token)

        This removes the configuration information about the mesh adapter
        identified by the 64-bit token parameter. The token parameter
        has been obtained as a result of successful Add() method call.

		PossibleErrors:
		    org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotFound,

Properties:
    bool Connected [read-only]

        This property indicates if the mesh adapter is connected.

    string LastError [read-only]

        This property indicates last error.

        The defined values are: "none", "handshake-error"

    uint64 SentCount [read-only]

        This property indicates count of sent messages.

    uint64 ReceivedCount [read-only]

        This property indicates count of received messages.
